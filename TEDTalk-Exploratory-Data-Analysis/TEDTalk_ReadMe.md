# TEDTalk Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is one of the first steps in the data science workflow. Conducting EDA on a new dataset allows us to do obtain a general idea on the trends and patterns available in a dataset. This will aid in conducting the necessary data preprocessing, data cleaning, feature engineering, and helps us decide the best machine learning model for our dataset.

This iPython notebook showcases the EDA for a dataset of TED Talks given throughout the years. The prompts are obtained from a PyCon 2019 code-along lecture by Kevin Markham.
