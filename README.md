# About me

1My name is [Shumayl Asmawi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shumayl-111/), and I am an Applied Physics fresh graduate. I am currently learning data science, and I am looking for ways to solve problems in the domains of semiconductor devices, renewable energy, materials science, and business intelligence using data!

# About the portfolio
This repository serves as a portfolio of some of my data science works - personal projects and capstone projects from online courses. They are presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb).

The depth and scope of each project varies, they include (but not limited to):
- Data cleaning
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Data visualization
- ML/artificial neural network model training
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Predictive analytics
- Model evaluation

This portfolio will grow as I learn more and do more projects.

**[EDA and Prediction of Solar Power Output](https://github.com/mshumayl/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Solar-Power-Output-Prediction)**

- Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to discover key analytics and diagnostics for a dataset of two solar power plants.
- Constructed a simple linear regression model to predict the output of the solar power plants which is accurate up to around 700kW (root mean squared error).

**[Kaggle TPS June 2021 Competition](https://github.com/mshumayl/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Kaggle-TPSCompetition-June2021)**

- Designed a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model and an XGBoost model to predict the category of 100,000 different products given over 70 different mystery features of over 200,000 existing products for Kaggle's June Tabular Playground Competition.
- Scored 1.77852 (competition winner scored 1.74370, multiclass log loss - lower is better) with predictions made by the XGBoost model.
