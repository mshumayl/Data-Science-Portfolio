# About me

My name is [Shumayl Asmawi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shumayl-111/), and I am an Applied Physics fresh graduate. I am currently learning data science, and I am looking for ways to solve problems in the domains of semiconductor devices, renewable energy, materials science, and business intelligence using data!

# About the portfolio
This repository serves as a portfolio of some of my data science works - personal projects and capstone projects from online courses. They are presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb).

The depth and scope of each project varies, they include (but not limited to):
- Data cleaning
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Data visualization
- ML/artificial neural network model training
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Predictive analytics
- Model evaluation

This portfolio will grow as I learn more and do more projects.

**[EDA and Prediction of Solar Power Output](https://github.com/mshumayl/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Solar-Power-Output-Prediction)**

Exploratory data analysis on a dataset of power output and weather sensor data obtained from two solar power plants in India. Predictive modelling is done using linear regression to predict the output of the solar power plants, given a test set of various time and weather conditions. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

#

**[Exploring Trends and Patterns of TED Talks (EDA)](https://github.com/mshumayl/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/TEDTalk-Exploratory-Data-Analysis)**

Exploratory data analysis on a dataset of over 2000 recorded TED Talks to visualize underlying trends and patterns regarding the popularity, sentiments, and ratings of the TED events.

#

**[Predicting House Prices with Neural Networks using Keras and Tensorflow](https://github.com/mshumayl/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/House-Price-Prediction-with-Neural-Network)**

Constructing a four-layer Artificial Neural Network using Keras and Tensorflow to predict the price of houses given a set of features. The training data is on house prices in the Seattle area. The Adam algorithm was used for optimization, and ReLU was used as the activation function for each point.

#

**[Predicting Classification on a Dataset of Unknown Features with K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm](https://github.com/mshumayl/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Classification-Prediction-KNN)**

Supervised learning using the K-NN algorithm to predict the target classes given a set of unknown features.

#

**[Predicting Loan Defaulting with Random Forest Classifier Algorithm](https://github.com/mshumayl/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Predicting-Loan-Return-with-Random-Forest-Classifier)**

Supervised learning using the Decision Trees algorithm and Random Forest ensemble to predict whether or not a loaner will default given information on applicants' FICO credit scores, annual income, loan purpose, matching criteria, and a few other features.

#

**[Predicting Flower Type with Support Vector Machine Algorithm](https://github.com/mshumayl/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Predicting-Flower-Type-with-SVM)**

Supervised learning using the Support Vector Machine algorithm to predict the target class between three types of flowers, given information on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of the flowers.

#

**[Unsupervised Learning with K-Means Clustering (Study)](https://github.com/mshumayl/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Learning-Unsupervised-Learning)** 

A study on supervised learning using the K-Means Clustering algorithm to investigate the relationships between the features of a dataset of private and public schools.
