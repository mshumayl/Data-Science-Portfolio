# Data Science Portfolio

## About me

My name is [Shumayl Asmawi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shumayl-111/), and I am an Applied Physics fresh graduate. I am currently learning data science, and I am looking for ways to solve problems in the domains of semiconductor devices, renewable energy, and materials science using data!

If you would like to talk, you can reach me through:

## About the portfolio
This repository serves as a portfolio of some of my data science works - personal projects and capstone projects from online courses. They are presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb).

The depth and scope of each project varies, they include (but not limited to):
- Data cleaning
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Data visualization
- ML/artificial neural network model training
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Predictive analytics
- Model evaluation

This portfolio will grow as I learn more and do more projects.

Exploratory data analysis on a dataset of power output and weather sensor data obtained from two solar power plants in India. Predictive modelling is done using linear regression to predict the output of the solar power plants, given a test set of various time and weather conditions. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

Constructing an Artificial Neural Network with four hidden layers with ReLU activation using Keras and Tensorflow to predict the price of houses given a set of features. The training data is on house prices in the Seattle, WA area. The Adam algorithm was used for optimization, and ReLU was used as the activation function for each points.
