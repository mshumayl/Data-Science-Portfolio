# Welcome to my data science portfolio.

This repo serves as a portfolio of some of my data science projects, and it includes various personal projects and capstone projects from online courses.

The depth and scope of each project varies, from data scraping, data cleaning, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data visualization, up to machine learning model training, neural network model training, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation and predictions, and model analysis.

Thank you for visiting this repo and feel free to contact me on LinkedIn @Shumayl Asmawi should you have any questions!
