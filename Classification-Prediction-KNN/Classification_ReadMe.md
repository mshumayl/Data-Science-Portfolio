# Classifying data based on unknown features

Oftentimes in the data science, we will be dealing with unknown features. Having no prior information on the features will limit our ability to do feature engineering on the available features. However, it is still possible to conduct other processes of the data science workflow on unknown dataset. 

In this notebook, the K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithm was used in order to classify test data into a target value of either 1 or 0.
