# K Means Clustering

K Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm. Unsupervised learning methods are used to study the relationships between a set of unknown features and derive patterns between these features through the clustering of similar features. Understanding the scope and aim of unsupervised learning algorithms is deeply reliant on domain knowledge/expertise, as it is highly subjective and mostly involves no output for evaluation. As an example, interpreting the results from an unsupervised learning task on a dataset of tumor characteristics may require the domain expertise of cancer scientists in the same way that interpreting a dataset of proton collision from CERN requires the domain knowledge of particle physicists. Some algorithms that are normally used for unsupervised learning include principal components analysis, k-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering among a few others.

For the learning purposes of this project however, we will use a labeled dataset in order to evaluate the accuracy of the K Means Clustering algorithm. In a real-world setting, evaluating a predicted output from unsupervised learning algorirthms are not this direct, and it is more about evaluating the relationships between the features.
